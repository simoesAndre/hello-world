My first GitHub Pages Repository

Good evening!

My name is André Simões, I'm studying the Internet Computer Technician. 
I've studied web development (html5, css, javascript, c#, ef core, bootstrap) 
and now I'm studying mobile development for Android (react native). 
I'm looking for opportunities to enter the job market.
